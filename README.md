# gericht-landing-page
My submission for the CodingOssey Challenge(March 2023)

This project was built with React, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion. 
The project works with the api by themealdb.com to fetch data and store it in state. It uses the Local Storage to create and update data in the Saved Foods section
